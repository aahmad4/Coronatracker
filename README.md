# Live Coronavirus Tracker
A live coronavirus tracker website made with a back-end of JavaScript/Python and a front-end of HTML/CSS. We hosted the website on glitch and you can find the link here: https://coronatracker.glitch.me/

# Repository Contents
- server.js: This contains our first back-end programming file which was written in Node.js. This file contains the web server and assets to run the python aspect and return the images of data to the end-user.
- server.py: This is our second back-end programming language. This file contains the logic for the server to communicate with the JavaScript and HTML. Also, this is where we have the logic written for using the Coronavirus Monitor Rapid API to make our own graphs with matplotlib and distrubute them to the end-user.
- index.html and style.css in the public folder both contain the front-end of the website and that's where we designed the user interface and overall design of the website. 

# How To Use
To use our Coronavirus tracker, simply use our drop drown and select any country you'd like, and instantly view live statistics regarding the disease in that country. We have another feature that allows the end-user to compare the amount of people with the disease in multiple countries. 

(Note: All statistics of Coronavirus are updated roughly once an hour)
